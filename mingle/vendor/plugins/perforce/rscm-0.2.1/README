= RSCM - Ruby Source Control Management (0.2.0)

RSCM is to SCM what DBI/JDBC/ODBC are to databases - an SCM-independent API for accessing a wide variety of SCMs. The features are roughly:

* Check out a working copy (with possibility to specify branch/date/label)
* Get changesets (changesets are emulated for non-transactional SCMs like CVS and StarTeam)
* Get diffs
* Add and commit files
* Manipluate triggers

== Download

RSCM is available as a RubyGem, and can be installed like this:

  gem install rscm

If you want the latest and greatest, you can get the sources, which live alongside DamageControl's sources:

== Supported SCMs

* CVS - http://www.cvshome.org (stable)
* Perforce - http://www.perforce.com (not thoroughly tested)
* StarTeam - http://www.borland.com/starteam (not thoroughly tested)
* Subversion - http://subversion.tigris.org (stable)

In progress:

* ClearCase -http://www-306.ibm.com/software/awdtools/clearcase (half way there)
* Darcs - http://www.abridgegame.org/darcs (very incomplete)
* Monotone - http://www.venge.net/monotone (half way there)

Planned:

Loads! All of them! How to add support for a new one is described further down in this file.

== Related projects

* DamageControl - http://damagecontrol.codehaus.org. DamageControl adds a web interface to RSCM and tons of other features for continuous integration.

== Sample usage

Here is an example of how to use RSCM to get a list of changesets from a CVS repository:

  require 'rscm'
  
  scm = RSCM::Subversion.new("svn://some.server/some/path/trunk", "trunk")

  scm.checkout("mycheckout")
  changesets = scm.changesets("mycheckout", Time.utc(2004, 11, 10, 12, 34, 22))
  changesets.each do |changeset|
    puts changeset
  end

=== Using visitors

Although ChangeSets and ChangeSet support external iteration (as in the example above), the preferred way 
to operate on them is to let a ChangeSets object +accept+ a visitor. A visitor
must respond to the following methods:

  def visit_changesets(changesets); end
  def visit_changeset(changeset); end
  def visit_change(change); end

=== Getting diffs

RSCM allows you to get diffs for changesets. This is done in the following way:

See the DamageControl sources for more detailed examples (DamageControl persists diffs to disk
and presents them as colourised diffs in its user interface).

== Future plans

=== Cross-SCM synchronisation

RSCM could be used as a tool to migrate files from one SCM to another (of a different type)
while keeping the history. -Similar to cvs2svn.

RSCM could also be used as a continuous synchronisation service between SCMs. This can be very useful
when you have to work with an SCM and you'd rather use a different one. RSCM could synchronise between
the central SCM and one that you set up on your local machine.

= Implementing support for a new SCM

We'd be happy to receive contributions for more SCMs. You can always
file a JIRA issue and hope for someone to implement it for you, or
you can do it yourself. The rest of this file should get you started.

N.B. IF YOU START IMPLEMENTING A NEW RSCM PLUGIN, PLEASE SUBMIT YOUR CODE
TO JIRA AT AN EARLY STAGE (BEFORE IT'S COMPLETE). THIS WAY IT'S EASIER
FOR EXISTING DEVELOPERS TO PROVIDE TIPS AND HELP UNDERWAY.

Let's write an RSCM implementation for the imaginary SCM called Mooky.
You should be able to use the same recipe for most SCMs.

== Writing the API

Start by writing a test:

  test/rscm/mooky/mooky_test.rb

By including GenericSCMTests your test will automatically include the
acceptance test suite for RSCM. By doing this you'll actually follow a TDD
approach for your new Mooky class - except that the tests are already written
for you!

IMPORTANT NOTE: If your SCM doesn't provide an easy way to create new local repositories 
(such as with StarTeam) you're probably better off writing the tests from scratch and not
include GenericSCMTests. Instead, just make sure you have an SCM repository set up somewhere
and write tests to work against that repository. This way you won't be able to pass the
generic acceptance test suite, and other people (like the RSCM dev team) will probably
not be able to run the tests for it. -But it's better than nothing. We'll happily accept
contributions that don't use the generic tests, although it would be best if they did.

OK, back to mooky. As you will see in a minute, the generic test suite will be of great
help when developing the Mooky class. The tests will attempt to check in some sample files
and call various methods on the mooky object to verify that it behaves correctly according
to the RSCM API. (The sample files consist of some java sources, but you don't need Java installed.
They're just files).

Let's implement the Mooky class. Take a look at.

  lib/rscm/scm/mooky.rb

Try running Mooky's test:

  rake test TEST=test/rscm/scm/mooky_test.rb
  
Whoops - we got some failures! It failed because our checkout method returned 
nothing (nil). Let'see if we can get the a little further by implementing this
method.

The Mooky SCM happens to have a command line utility to perform a checkout.
From the command line a checkout with mooky would be done like this:

  cd somewhere
  mooky checkout --repo mooky://some/where/else

Running this command will print the following to standard out:

  checkout build.xml
  checkout project.xml
  checkout src/java/com/thoughtworks/damagecontrolled/Thingy.java
  checkout src/test/com/thoughtworks/damagecontrolled/ThingyTestCase.java
  
What we need to do is to execute these commands from Ruby. We also need to 
parse the output from the mooky command to determine the files that were checked out,
so that we can return an array with the file names of the checked out files (the method 
should also yield each file name as the execution proceeds).

Once your checkout command works okay, the test will get you a little further. Just keep
on going until all tests pass.

NOTE: If the SCM doesn't have a command line utility (unlikely) or a 3rd party Ruby API, but instead
provides libraries (perhaps in C), then you should consider writing a Ruby C extension
instead.

If the SCM has a Java interface, you can take the same approach as for StarTeam. There are
Java classes for ChangeSets that allow easy interaction between Ruby and Java over YAML. 
You can reuse these classes for other Java based SCMs (if there are any, I don't know).

== Web interface (DamageControl only)

DamageControl automatically detects new SCM classes in RSCM and generates a default web interface.

= Building RSCM
This section is for developers who are new to ruby development and do not already know how to build and install Ruby gems.

You need to install rubygems from http://rubyforge.org/projects/rubygems
Afterwards you need to install rake and rails

  gem install rake

Now change to the RSCM root directory and type

  rake gem

This will create a gem for RSCM. To install this gem, you have to change to the pgk directory and type

  sudo gem install pkg/rscm-0.1.0.gem
  
Now you can use RSCM in other Ruby apps.
